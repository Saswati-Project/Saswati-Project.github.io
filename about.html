  <section>
    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Saswati , a roboticist. I spend my days teaching robots how to walk, talk, and occasionally fall down with dignity.ðŸ˜‚</p>

    <p>I am a Phd student of Computer Science at University At Albany - State University of New York. I am a researcher in the Robotics, Algorithm and Computable Systems (RACS) Laboratory working under the supervision of 
      Dr. Chinwe Ekenna.My research is primarily focused on mobile robotics, with a particular emphasis on autonomous navigation. A broader objective of my work is to design systems that can be used by individuals
      irrespective of their technical expertise. Instead of relying heavily on coordinates, actuators, and sensor-based navigation commands, I aim to develop robotic systems capable of interpreting and executing 
      instructions expressed in natural human language.</p>
    <p>This research is driven by several key questions:</p>
   <ol>
  <li>How can robots be trained to understand essential phrases in human instructions?</li>
  <li>What should constitute the key phrases for navigation tasks?</li>
  <li>Given that the user already provides guidance on how the robot should move within the environment, how can path-planning methodologies be optimized?</li>
</ol>

   <p>To address these questions, I employ Named Entity Recognition (NER), a widely used method in natural language processing, to identify critical phrases in navigation commands and map them to a motion planner 
     for generating collision-free trajectories. Since the robot receives explicit guidance on the types of turns required to reach the destination, my work focuses on generating samples within a relevant subset 
     of the environment rather than across the entire workspace. This approach makes the planner both sample-efficient and time-efficient. Consequently, my current research represents an integration of artificial 
     intelligence and robotics, uniting natural language understanding with efficient sampling-based path planning.</p>
